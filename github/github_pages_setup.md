# Where to better invoke github pages ? on root or docs ? What structure use respectively ?

Where you invoke GitHub Pages depends on your preferences and the structure of your repository. Here’s a breakdown of the two common methods and their respective structures:

---

### **1. Using the Root (`/`) Directory**

GitHub Pages can be invoked from the root of your repository. This is ideal for small projects, websites, or personal pages where simplicity is key.

#### **Advantages:**

-   Easier to manage for simple projects.
-   No need for additional folders; your site's content is immediately accessible.
-   Default behavior for many GitHub Pages projects.

#### **Repository Structure:**

```
/ (root)
├── index.html    # Homepage for GitHub Pages
├── style.css     # Stylesheet
├── script.js     # JavaScript file
├── images/       # Folder for images
└── other files   # Additional resources
```

#### **Setup Steps:**

1. Go to **Settings > Pages** in your GitHub repository.
2. Select the `main` branch as the source.
3. Ensure that `/(root)` is chosen as the folder.

### **2. Using the `/docs` Directory**

This approach is better for larger projects, repositories with code, or if you want to separate website files from the main project files.

#### **Advantages:**

-   Keeps website files separate from the project's code or assets.
-   Ideal for documentation or projects with multiple components.
-   Maintains a cleaner root directory for your repository.

#### **Repository Structure:**

```
/ (root)
├── src/              # Source code of the project
├── docs/             # GitHub Pages website
│   ├── index.html    # Homepage for GitHub Pages
│   ├── style.css     # Stylesheet
│   ├── script.js     # JavaScript file
│   └── images/       # Folder for images
├── README.md         # Repository description
└── other project files
```

#### **Setup Steps:**

1. Go to **Settings > Pages** in your GitHub repository.
2. Select the `main` branch as the source.
3. Choose the `/docs` folder.

### **Best Practices**

1. **Use Root Directory**:
    - For portfolio sites, small projects, or personal blogs.
    - Simplifies navigation for visitors and contributors.
2. **Use `/docs` Directory**:
    - For projects with significant source code or multiple unrelated files.
    - For project documentation or if GitHub Pages is secondary to your main repository purpose.

If you're unsure, start with the `/docs` directory. It's more organized and easier to migrate to the root if necessary later.
