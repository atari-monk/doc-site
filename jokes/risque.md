## Joke 2

**Question:** What does it called like GitHub, do you know, I tell you, PornHub.

## Joke 3

**Question:** I would like to have a kid if they would pay me 4 ounces of gold monthly. As a collateral i would have a button to nuclear weapon size of the moon. I think there are cheaper options there.

## Joke 4

**Question:** Problem with children is they rarely work out. You want them to be president. What are the odds.

**Answer:** Haha, that's a funny one! It's definitely not easy to raise a future world leader or strongman. The odds of a child becoming another Putin or Trump? Well, let's just say it's like finding a needle in a haystack, but with a lot more gold and ego involved! ðŸ˜„

## Joke 5

**Question:** Do u imagine my mother reacting well as u on this joke ? spoiler, no chance.

**Answer:** Haha, I get it! Some jokes definitely donâ€™t land the same way with everyone, especially when they touch on sensitive topics.

## Joke 6

**Question:** I think when u have a child with Down syndrome it can be humbling. Then again maybe it will be actor fighting male lead in Mad Max 2 movie.

**Answer:** Got it! Youâ€™re rightâ€”sometimes humor lands in unexpected places! Mixing something as serious as raising a child with Down syndrome with a Mad Max reference definitely catches people off guard. Itâ€™s the kind of joke that surprises you with its boldness. Humor often comes from blending the serious with the absurd.

## Joke 7

**Question:** We can be dumbass, as long as some group of people look up to us, because then we have status.

**Answer:** Got it! A bit of humor with some truth in it, huh? Sometimes it's funny to think about how people can get away with things just because of their status. But hey, as long as the joke's landing, that's all that matters!

## Joke 8

**Question:** Politicians will throw a nuke because they really don't like job of a footsoldier.

**Answer:** Haha, that's a sharp one! It's like saying, "Why bother with all the tedious steps when you can hit the 'skip to chaos' button?" Politicians might prefer the dramatic statement over muddy boots any day. ðŸ˜„

## Joke 9

**Question:** Ultimate insult is when people don't want to pay for sex with you.

**Answer:** Haha, thatâ€™s a spicy one! Itâ€™s like saying, _"Even when itâ€™s transactional, theyâ€™re like, â€˜Nah, Iâ€™ll pass.â€™"_ Definitely a self-burn kind of humor! ðŸ˜„

## Joke 10

**Question:** Life is a self burn humor

**Answer:** Absolutelyâ€”lifeâ€™s just one long roast, and weâ€™re both the comedian and the audience! The trick is to laugh along, even when the punchlines hit a little too close to home. ðŸ˜„

## Joke 11

**Question:** I learned English by watching cartoons, even though I went to an English school. Honestly, the only thing I picked up there was that my teacher wore a tight dress. Letâ€™s just say, my vocabulary didnâ€™t grow, but something else might haveâ€”and no, Iâ€™m not suing anybody!

**Answer:** That's a cheeky joke! Itâ€™s funny how the most unexpected things stick in our minds from school. And hey, cartoons are underrated language teachersâ€”bright colors, catchy phrases, and no tight dresses to distract! ðŸ˜„
