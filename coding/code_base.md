# Code Base

## Ts project has code base and is somewhat operiational. Code quality is bit lacking. Should i upgrade it in place or start new repo with better quality ?

Whether to upgrade your TypeScript project in place or start a new repository depends on the current state of the code and your goals. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide:

---

### **Upgrade In Place**

#### Best For:

-   **Incremental Improvements**: If the codebase is functional and just needs refactoring for better quality.
-   **Continuity**: If you want to maintain the existing history of commits and avoid disrupting collaborators or integrations.
-   **Faster Iteration**: You don’t need to rebuild core functionality; instead, you improve as you go.

#### Pros:

1. **Preserves History**: Commit history helps trace decisions and bug origins.
2. **Easier Transition**: No need to recreate dependencies, tests, or workflows from scratch.
3. **Focused Improvement**: You can target problematic areas systematically.

#### How To Do It:

-   **Set Standards First**: Define your goals for code quality (e.g., modularity, readability, test coverage).
-   **Refactor by Modules/Features**: Improve one area at a time rather than the whole project at once.
-   **Implement CI Tools**: Add linters (ESLint), formatters (Prettier), and tests for automatic checks as you refactor.
-   **Tag Stable Versions**: Use git tags or branches to mark current stable states before making large changes.

### **Start a New Repository**

#### Best For:

-   **Major Structural Overhaul**: If the current codebase is highly disorganized, hard to debug, or limits new feature development.
-   **Exploring New Ideas**: If you want to experiment with different architecture, patterns, or tools.
-   **Clean Break**: If the current code is difficult to refactor without breaking core functionality.

#### Pros:

1. **Fresh Start**: No legacy baggage to hinder new designs.
2. **Immediate Quality Boost**: You can enforce high standards from the beginning.
3. **Focused Effort**: You spend more time designing and less time untangling old issues.

#### How To Do It:

-   **Audit the Existing Codebase**: Identify reusable parts (e.g., algorithms, utilities) to port over.
-   **Plan Architecture**: Draft a structure that fixes the flaws of the current project.
-   **Migrate Incrementally**: Use the old repo as a reference while building and testing the new one.

### **Key Considerations**

1. **Time Investment**:

    - In-place upgrades are less disruptive but may take longer overall to reach high quality.
    - Starting fresh has higher upfront cost but might be faster for a large overhaul.

2. **Project Size**:

    - For small-to-medium projects: Upgrade in place might be more efficient.
    - For large projects: Starting fresh can prevent the complexity of untangling a deeply flawed structure.

3. **Code Quality Debt**:

    - If the existing code is so messy that every change feels like a struggle, starting fresh is likely better.

4. **Stakeholders**:
    - If others depend on the current project, upgrading in place ensures continuity.
    - If you work alone, a fresh start is easier to manage.

### Recommendation

-   **If the codebase is functional and not fundamentally broken**: Upgrade in place. Focus on incremental improvements, like introducing modular designs, linting, and better testing.
-   **If the project is a nightmare to work with or you want a clean slate**: Start a new repository but reuse components where possible.
