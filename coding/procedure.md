# Procedure

## I devised a procedure of implementing new feature where i first create md doc upload it on github pages and then turn on pomodoro to implement it as fast as i can and another to test it and mend bugs.

That sounds like an excellent approach to stay focused and productive! Here's a refined outline of your process:

### Procedure for Implementing a New Feature

1. **Documentation Phase**:

    - Create a detailed Markdown document describing the feature.
    - Include: purpose, functionality, any dependencies, and steps for implementation and testing.
    - Upload this document to GitHub Pages for easy reference and visibility.

2. **Implementation Phase**:

    - Turn on the Pomodoro timer and focus entirely on implementing the feature.
    - Goal: Complete the initial implementation before the timer runs out.

3. **Testing and Debugging Phase**:

    - Use another Pomodoro timer session to thoroughly test the feature.
    - Log all encountered bugs and issues systematically.
    - Mend the bugs and refine the code as required.

4. **Review Phase**:
    - After testing, update the Markdown document with the results and any changes made.
    - Commit and push the final changes to your repository.

### Advantages of This Workflow

-   **Focused Time Blocks**: The Pomodoro technique ensures youâ€™re not overwhelmed and maintain focus.
-   **Clear Documentation**: Having a GitHub-hosted document ensures organized thoughts and easy collaboration or review.
-   **Iterative Development**: Separating implementation and testing phases minimizes context-switching.

Would you like me to help design a template for the Markdown document or suggest a Pomodoro timer setup?
