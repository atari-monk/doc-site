# Plans

## I enjoy cli py project. I also have engine in ts to work on and i want to do big react tutorial. How should i split my time.

To effectively split your time among your CLI Python project, TypeScript engine, and a big React tutorial, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Assess Priorities**

-   **Immediate goals:** Are you trying to finish one project soon, or do all three have equal weight?
-   **Learning vs. Building:** Is the React tutorial mainly for skill development, while the other two are production-focused?

### 2. **Time Allocation**

Since you're working on multiple types of projects:

-   **CLI Python Project** (Production/Development): 40%  
    Focus here if itâ€™s a near-term goal or critical to complete. Break tasks into small deliverables.
-   **TypeScript Engine** (Ongoing development): 30%  
    Dedicate less time but keep steady progress. This keeps your skills sharp and the project moving forward.
-   **React Tutorial** (Learning): 30%  
    A chunk of your time should be on leveling up your React skills, as it could benefit future projects.

### 3. **Weekly Schedule**

Split your workdays or weeks:

-   **Focused Work Blocks:**  
    Allocate **2 hours per session** per day, targeting one project per session. Example:
    -   Morning: CLI Python
    -   Afternoon: TypeScript Engine
    -   Evening: React Tutorial
-   Alternatively, **theme days**:
    -   Monday-Wednesday: CLI Python
    -   Thursday-Friday: TypeScript Engine
    -   Saturday-Sunday: React Tutorial

### 4. **Track Progress**

-   Keep a log for each project (even a simple checklist) to note completed tasks.
-   Adjust time allocation weekly based on progress or deadlines.

### 5. **Relaxation and Context-Switching**

-   Plan short breaks when switching projects.
-   Spend evenings relaxing with lighter tasks, like exploring React concepts in a less intensive way.
