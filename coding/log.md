I spent most of my time working on the **CLI app** alone and didn't integrate py frameworks for the CLI commands.  
I created **key value storage**.  
I can't create a separate repository for every command; many of them will need to be bundled into a single repo,  
with some commands having their own repos. For now, I don’t want to focus on frameworks,  
as my CLI seems to be working in some capacity.  
**Plan:** Next, I want to add a repository for file-based data, and the CLI can have its key value storage there.  
I want to move the log command into my current CLI tool setup.
