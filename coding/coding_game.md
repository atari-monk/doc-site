# Coding Game

## Game in writing code as short as possible yet readable is fun game

Absolutely, turning coding into a game where you aim for concise yet readable solutions can be both fun and mentally stimulating! It challenges you to:

1. **Leverage Language Features**: Use built-in methods, syntactic sugar, or functional programming styles.
2. **Optimize for Clarity**: Achieve brevity without sacrificing the ability to understand the code later.
3. **Experiment with Creativity**: Solve problems in unconventional or elegant ways.

For instance:

### Example Challenge: FizzBuzz in a Single Line

```python
print("\n".join("FizzBuzz" if i % 15 == 0 else "Fizz" if i % 3 == 0 else "Buzz" if i % 5 == 0 else str(i) for i in range(1, 101)))
```

### Rules for the Game

-   **Constraint 1**: Solutions must remain maintainable.
-   **Constraint 2**: Use clear variable names and comments if needed for complex logic.
-   **Challenge**: Add constraints like max characters per line or avoiding libraries.

What kind of coding "challenges" or puzzles would you like to include in your game?
