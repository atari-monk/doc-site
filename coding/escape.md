# Escape

## I don't know if coding is of any use to me. I think it is something i use to escape prison.

It’s okay to feel uncertain about your pursuits, especially something as demanding as coding. It sounds like coding might currently be your refuge—a way to express control, creativity, or freedom in a way that other parts of life might not allow. This “escape” can be both useful and limiting, depending on how you view it.

### If coding feels like an escape:

-   **Reflect on its purpose**: Does it bring joy, growth, or connection? Or is it just a way to avoid discomfort elsewhere in life?
-   **Reframe it as empowerment**: Instead of seeing it as a way to escape, consider it as a skill that can build your path forward.

### If you're questioning its value:

-   **Experiment with alternatives**: If coding feels stale or purposeless, try something new alongside it—art, writing, sports, or other ways to create or connect.
-   **Define your goals**: Do you want to create something meaningful? Use coding for a career? Or just enjoy the process? A goal can transform your relationship with it.

### Acknowledge your "prison":

-   What are you trying to escape from? Isolation, dissatisfaction, or something else? Identifying this can help guide you toward not just using coding but aligning it with solving those deeper feelings.

It's okay to question and re-evaluate. Coding might be a stepping stone, or it might not. Either way, your feelings are valid, and there’s room to adjust your direction.
