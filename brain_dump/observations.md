# Observations

## One liners

-   People are who\*\*\*. Selling body, sell everything else. They are very content with themselves. Yet animals.

-   Isn't it interesting, 50% of people probably reproduce out of shear stupidity, if that is so then survival of the species depend on stupidity, or self annihilation does, depend how u look at it.

-   When group A reproduce it is success. When B it is a failure depending on who is saying that (A). It shows total hypocrisy.

-   Both group A and B think they are at most importance. So are their kids. It is just not true, illusion.

## Bottom

**Question:** I think when u are on bottom of society, the game reverse it is not about how much y can get but on how little we can survive. Because jobs on bottom are bad and less doing them means better

**Answer:** That's an insightful observation. When resources are scarce, and the jobs available are difficult or degrading, survival often becomes a matter of minimizing harm rather than maximizing gain. In such circumstances, efficiency isn't about achieving more but conserving energy, dignity, and sanity while avoiding exploitation.

This shift in perspective—valuing minimal survival over accumulation—could indeed redefine "success" in a bottom-tier environment. It’s about finding balance and strategies that minimize suffering while perhaps leaving room to explore opportunities for gradual improvement.

## Pecking Order

**Question:** Below a million you don't exist. Above a million you get better treatment. Above a billion you get pretty good. Above 100 billion you matter.

**Answer:** This perspective highlights the often harsh realities of how society and systems prioritize individuals based on wealth or influence. It reflects a tiered view of value where access, opportunities, and respect seem to increase exponentially with financial or societal capital.

While it's an insightful commentary on societal dynamics, it also begs deeper questions:

-   **What should truly define a person's value?** Is it their financial worth, their character, or their impact on others?
-   **What does "mattering" mean?** Is it about power, legacy, or the ability to affect change?
-   **How do people find personal worth in a system that prioritizes wealth?**

This hierarchy can also serve as a motivator or a critique, depending on one's outlook. For some, it's a stark reminder to chase success; for others, it's a call to challenge the structures that perpetuate these values.

How do you personally feel about this framework? Do you see it as a reality to navigate or something to challenge?

**Question:** I don't care that much. It exist also on knowledge and anything. It's like pecking chicken. You have to let go at some point.

**Answer:** That's a grounded way to look at it. Acknowledging the "pecking order" of wealth, knowledge, or influence as a natural dynamic is liberating if you choose not to be consumed by it. Recognizing that there’s always a higher rung can prevent endless striving and help you focus on what truly matters to you.

Letting go—whether of societal expectations, comparisons, or the pursuit of being "at the top"—is a powerful act of self-agency. It allows for peace, creativity, and fulfillment in your own terms rather than by someone else's hierarchy.

Do you find it challenging to let go, or is it something you’ve naturally come to?
