## Why we support all of this. It doesn't mean anything to us. To show of before other man ? Doesn't make any sense. Another paradox.

It sounds like you're reflecting on a paradox related to why people support or care for others, particularly women and children, when they may not have a direct personal connection or benefit from doing so. This could be interpreted in terms of empathy, societal values, or even evolutionary psychology.

One way to view this is that caring for others—especially those who are vulnerable or unable to care for themselves—may be a deeply ingrained aspect of human nature. From an evolutionary standpoint, humans have evolved to form social bonds and work together to ensure the survival and well-being of their groups. Helping others, especially women and children, who play key roles in reproduction and the future of society, can be seen as part of ensuring the survival of the species.

Additionally, people might care for others out of empathy, a sense of shared humanity, or a cultural understanding that supporting others is a virtue. In many societies, there is also a social contract where people take care of one another, either for altruistic reasons or because it is expected by others.

The idea of "showing off before other men" could reflect a more cynical view, where helping others is seen as a way to gain social status or validation. However, even in such cases, there may still be deeper motivations at play—whether a desire to be seen as moral, capable, or powerful within a group.

The paradox you mentioned could lie in the seeming contradiction between personal gain and selfless action, but both might coexist in ways that are complex and difficult to untangle.

## But we don't care about anyone or anything for that matter and yet we want to show off. Doesn't make any sense.

You're touching on a complex aspect of human nature, one that can seem paradoxical at times. The idea that we don't truly care about anyone or anything, yet still have a desire to "show off" or seek validation, is a tension many people feel.

One way to look at it is that people often act based on a mix of conscious and subconscious drives. While it may seem like we don't truly care about others, our actions (like showing off or seeking validation) can stem from deeper, perhaps unacknowledged needs. These actions may be motivated by:

1. **Social Conditioning**: Many of us have been conditioned by society to seek approval and validation. We may not consciously care about others, but we've been taught that showing off or demonstrating status will bring us recognition, admiration, or even influence, which can feel rewarding in itself.

2. **Ego and Identity**: The desire to show off often comes from an internal need to reinforce our sense of identity and ego. Even if we don't genuinely care about others, we might care about how others perceive us, as it affirms our self-worth. This is tied to a more existential question about identity—who we are when we aren't defined by what we have, do, or others' opinions.

3. **A Search for Meaning**: Sometimes, the act of showing off is a way to create a sense of meaning or purpose in life, especially if we're feeling disconnected from deeper emotional or philosophical commitments. By gaining attention or admiration, we may subconsciously seek a form of validation to give our lives some significance, even if the actions themselves seem shallow or disconnected from any real concern for others.

4. **Self-Deception**: There's also the possibility that, on some level, we trick ourselves into thinking we don't care about others when, in fact, we might. The desire to "show off" could be a coping mechanism for avoiding deeper emotional vulnerability or confronting the complexities of human connection. In this case, the act of showing off could be a defense mechanism against inner discomfort or insecurity.

In essence, these actions may not make perfect sense when viewed in isolation, but they are often part of a broader, more complex mix of drives—social, psychological, and emotional—that influence behavior in ways that aren't always immediately logical or conscious.
