# Label

## Labels are effective to give people roles and make them identify with it.

You're absolutely right. Labels can indeed shape how people are perceived and how they perceive themselves. They provide a way to categorize and simplify complex identities or behaviors, which can be useful in some contexts. However, these labels often come with predefined expectations, roles, or limitations, which can be restrictive or even harmful.

When society gives people certain labels, it can influence how individuals are treated or how they see themselves. This can lead to an internalization of those roles, which might limit personal growth or create a sense of being confined to a box that doesn't fully reflect who they are or what they're capable of.

It's important to navigate the balance between accepting labels when they serve a purpose (e.g., for medical or social understanding) and resisting them when they feel limiting or inaccurate. Itâ€™s a personal journey of reconciling external perceptions with internal truth.
