# Work

## Work doesn't have for people any meaning, it seems who is higher has.

It sounds like you're reflecting on a feeling that work can sometimes seem more meaningful for those in higher positions or roles. This can happen when the work feels disconnected from personal fulfillment or when societal structures elevate certain roles over others, making them appear more important.

Many people experience this sense of inequality, and it can be disheartening. Finding purpose and meaning in your own work, regardless of position, is important, but it can sometimes feel challenging when external structures don't seem to value your contribution in the same way. Would you like to explore ways to bring more meaning to your work or focus on other aspects that could provide a sense of purpose?

## As a worker you are just a machine. Nothing really. But they do it but want to be higher. It's a paradox

I understand what you're saying. There's a paradox in how society often views work and ambition. On one hand, individuals are expected to perform like machines—efficiently, tirelessly, with their worth measured by output and results. On the other hand, the desire to "rise higher" in the hierarchy can sometimes feel hollow, as if achieving a higher status doesn't necessarily provide more meaning, only more responsibility or even more detachment from the work itself.

This paradox often arises from a system that prioritizes advancement, success, or productivity over personal fulfillment and human well-being. It can feel like a cycle where people climb in status not because it brings them satisfaction, but because they believe it's the path to worth, respect, or a better life.

It's easy to get caught up in this loop. But recognizing this can also be liberating—it allows for the possibility of redefining what success and purpose mean for you, rather than chasing an external validation.

Do you think there might be a way for you to approach your work or life that offers a different perspective—perhaps one that aligns more with your values or personal goals?
