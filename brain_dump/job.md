# Job

## All this humans that have a job without any meaning or sense just to get bowl of rice

It can definitely feel disheartening when we think about how many people end up doing work that feels disconnected from any deeper meaning or personal fulfillment. The necessity to earn a living often leads individuals to take jobs that are purely for survival rather than passion or purpose. It can sometimes feel like people are stuck in a cycle where the goal is simply to "get the bowl of rice," as you put it.

Finding meaning in work can be challenging, especially when the environment is structured around financial needs or expectations rather than personal values. Many people end up spending the majority of their waking hours on tasks that may not resonate with them, which can lead to burnout or dissatisfaction. At the same time, there are those who manage to carve out their own sense of purpose through creative projects, hobbies, or side ventures—anything that gives their time more meaning beyond just a paycheck.

Do you feel the same kind of pressure with your own work, or is it more about observing others' struggles with purpose in their daily lives?

## For example woman sitting in job center that don't give any jobs.

It sounds like you're describing a situation where people, like the woman in the job center, are stuck in a system that seems to offer little hope or meaningful opportunity. The frustration of sitting in a place where you're supposed to find a job, but nothing materializes, can be incredibly demoralizing. It highlights a broader issue—how difficult it can be for people to escape a cycle of unemployment or underemployment when the systems meant to support them are ineffective, disorganized, or don't align with their actual needs.

This can feel especially painful when someone is just trying to survive, maybe even with a sense of desperation, but the system itself fails to provide viable solutions or opportunities. It creates a sense of helplessness and a lack of control over one’s own future. In a way, it's like being stuck in a limbo where you're doing the "right thing" by showing up to the job center, but there's no tangible outcome or progress.

It can be discouraging to witness or experience, especially when it's not just about finding any job, but finding one that can offer stability, respect, and fulfillment. It brings up questions about how society structures opportunities and the inherent value (or lack thereof) that’s placed on certain kinds of work and on the people who perform it.

## It would be better to just enter train. Do 2 stops. Kiss someone in ass. Go back. Meaningless

It sounds like you're expressing a deep frustration with the sense of meaninglessness in certain actions or routines. That feeling—like performing a task or going through the motions without any real purpose—can be overwhelming. The metaphor of "entering the train, doing two stops, kissing someone’s ass, and going back" paints a picture of something that feels absurd or pointless, like a cycle that doesn’t lead anywhere fulfilling.

Sometimes, when we’re stuck in repetitive or unfulfilling situations, it can feel as though life is a series of meaningless actions, especially when we’re surrounded by systems that don’t seem to care or provide real value. This sense of detachment can make it harder to see the purpose in everyday tasks, and it can make everything seem trivial, even when there’s a desire for something more meaningful.

Finding a sense of purpose or meaning, even in small things, can be difficult in such a world. But sometimes, even in moments that feel disconnected or frustrating, there are opportunities for small changes, or connections, that can shift how we experience the world. Whether through personal projects, changes in perspective, or finding ways to create meaning outside of societal expectations, there’s always the possibility for a different kind of fulfillment. Does any of that resonate with how you're feeling?

## And people live like that entire life. Maybe this is life.

It can certainly feel like life, for many people, becomes an endless loop of routines and obligations that seem disconnected from any deeper meaning. The thought that many live in this way their entire lives—just getting by, going through the motions, fulfilling responsibilities without a sense of fulfillment or passion—can be a hard reality to face. It’s a sobering reflection on the pressures, systems, and expectations that shape our lives in ways that might not allow room for individuality or deeper satisfaction.

Sometimes, we end up questioning whether the pursuit of meaning is just an illusion, or if we’re meant to find fulfillment in these repetitive cycles. If everyone is caught in the same grind, does that make it the "norm"? Does it make it acceptable or inevitable? There’s a tension between wanting something more meaningful and the reality of what most people experience day-to-day.

Yet, even within that, there can still be moments of choice. Some people might find small sparks of purpose in their families, friendships, creative endeavors, or passions outside of work. Others might find solace in accepting the impermanence or absurdity of life, taking comfort in simply existing for the sake of existing.

What are your thoughts? Do you feel like you’re searching for something beyond the cycle, or are you reflecting on how people live in general?
