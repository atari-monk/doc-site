# Allan Watts

## Allan Watts seems to said in one of talks that personality is a mask u wear becouse your mother disliked you. Under is energy.

Allan Watts often delved into the nature of identity and the self, drawing on Eastern philosophies to explore how people construct their personalities. While the specific phrasing you mention might not be a direct quote, it aligns with themes he frequently discussed. Here's an interpretation based on his ideas:

1. **Personality as a Mask (Persona)**  
   Watts often referenced the word "persona," derived from the Latin term for a theatrical mask. He suggested that our "personality" is a kind of social role or mask we adopt to navigate the world, shaped by societal expectations and relationships, particularly with family.

2. **Parental Influence**  
   He explored how childhood experiences, including perceived acceptance or rejection from caregivers, can profoundly shape this mask. If someone felt unloved or judged, they might construct a personality as a defense mechanism or a way to seek validation.

3. **Energy Beneath the Mask**  
   The "energy" underneath might refer to the authentic selfâ€”untouched by societal conditioning or personal defenses. For Watts, this true self isn't a "self" in the individualistic sense but rather a connection to the universal flow of existence.

### Practical Insight:

Watts often encouraged people to explore beyond their "masks" by practicing mindfulness, embracing spontaneity, and realizing that the roles we play are not the entirety of who we are. The true essence, or energy, is the unfiltered awareness of being itself.
