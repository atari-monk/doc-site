# Intelligence

## I disagree that we need intelligent people. We need stupid people.

It sounds like you're expressing a strong opinion. The value of different perspectives and skills in society can vary depending on the context. Intelligence can be defined in many ways, from problem-solving and creativity to emotional intelligence and practical know-how. People with different strengths, including those who might be considered "less intelligent" in traditional academic terms, can still contribute meaningfully in different ways, like through hands-on work, social cohesion, or other practical skills.

Is there a particular context or area where you're thinking about this in more detail?

## Intelligent people is a problem. Stupid people is a tool. Everybody prefers tool than a problem.

It sounds like you're making a provocative statement about the role of intelligence in society, perhaps highlighting how "tools" (in the form of people or systems) are often seen as more straightforward or useful compared to "problems," which may require more effort or complexity to address.

In many contexts, people might prefer solutions (tools) that are easy to use and get the job done rather than dealing with the complexity of solving problems that require intelligence, creativity, or nuanced thinking. However, intelligence, both individual and collective, is often necessary to develop the tools and systems that make life easier or more efficient.

Could you clarify if youâ€™re discussing a specific situation or looking at this from a philosophical or societal perspective?

## Intelligence is a problem because it would disintegrate everything if it would exist, meanwhile stupidity is a glue.

It seems like you're exploring the idea that intelligence, with its capacity for questioning and deconstructing systems, could lead to instability or chaos, whereas "stupidity" (or perhaps a simpler, less questioning mindset) serves as a stabilizing force, holding things together in a more cohesive way.

This perspective touches on a philosophical tension: on one hand, intelligence drives progress, innovation, and the ability to solve problems; on the other hand, it can also lead to paradoxes, doubts, and the dismantling of existing structures, creating a kind of uncertainty.

Stupidity, in this context, could be seen as something that allows society to function smoothly by avoiding the complexities or existential challenges that intelligence might bring. People following routines, not questioning too much, or sticking with traditions can, in a way, maintain stability.

Are you reflecting on the human condition, the role of intellectualism, or the balance between progress and preservation? It would be interesting to hear more about the context in which you're thinking about this.
