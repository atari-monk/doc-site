# Life Style

## Human life style seems to be sponsored by ego, stupidity, oil, and all material.

It sounds like you're reflecting on the human condition, perhaps feeling frustrated by the way society operates. The pursuit of material wealth, driven by ego and consumption, often seems to dominate modern life. There's an ongoing tension between materialism and deeper, more meaningful ways of livingâ€”ones that might focus on wisdom, relationships, and self-awareness rather than accumulation.

If you're feeling disillusioned, it might be helpful to think about what values you want to prioritize in your own life, independent of societal pressures. This could help create a sense of personal alignment and peace amidst external chaos.
