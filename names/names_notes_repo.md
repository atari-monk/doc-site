# How to name repo where i have github pages on root and put there md files with notes ?

A good repository name for a GitHub Pages site that hosts Markdown notes should be descriptive, simple, and aligned with your organizational style. Here are some ideas:

1. **`notes-hub`**: A central hub for your notes.
2. **`markdown-notes`**: Emphasizing the Markdown format.
3. **`notes-archive`**: If the repository is meant to store and organize notes.
4. **`pages-notes`**: Highlighting that it uses GitHub Pages.
5. **`knowledge-base`**: Suitable if it's a comprehensive collection of information.
6. **`md-notes`**: Short and to the point, referencing Markdown.
7. **`doc-site`**: If you want to imply itâ€™s a documentation-style site.
8. **`thoughts-and-notes`**: A bit more personal and casual.
9. **`notes-repo`**: Straightforward and self-explanatory.
10. **`brain-dump`**: If the notes are less formal and exploratory.

### Example Format for Naming:

-   Combine your topic or focus with a structure:
    -   **`my-notes`**
    -   **`tech-notes`**
    -   **`personal-wiki`**
    -   **`project-journal`**

### Why the Name Matters:

-   It helps visitors understand the content at a glance.
-   Makes the repository easier to find or reference later.
-   Provides clarity about the repository's purpose in your own workflow.

Would you like the name to reflect a specific style or focus area (e.g., personal, technical, casual)?
