## How to select python interpreter in Visual Studio Code ?

To select a Python interpreter in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), follow these steps:

1. **Open Command Palette:**

    - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) to open the Command Palette.

2. **Select Interpreter:**

    - Type **"Python: Select Interpreter"** in the Command Palette search box and select it.

3. **Choose the Interpreter:**

    - A list of available Python interpreters will appear. Select the one you want to use for your project. This can include virtual environments, global Python installations, or conda environments.

4. **Set for Workspace (Optional):**

    - If you want to set the interpreter for the specific workspace (and not globally), make sure you are in the desired workspace folder before selecting the interpreter.

5. **Verify Selection:**
    - You can verify the selected interpreter by looking at the bottom-left corner of the VSCode window. The Python interpreter should be listed there.

By doing this, you ensure that your code uses the appropriate Python environment.
