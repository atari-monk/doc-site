# Chrome Dark Mode

To turn Dark Mode on or off in Google Chrome using the `chrome://flags/` page, follow these steps:

### 1. Open Chrome and Access the Flags Page

First, make sure you're using Google Chrome as your browser. In the address bar, type the following:

```
chrome://flags/
```

Press **Enter** to open the Chrome Flags page. This page contains experimental features that are not yet officially part of the browser, including settings that control visual aspects such as Dark Mode.

### 2. Search for Dark Mode Settings

Once on the `chrome://flags/` page, you'll see a search bar at the top. Type "Dark Mode" or "Force Dark Mode" into the search bar to locate the related flags.

### 3. Enable Dark Mode

Look for a flag called **"Force Dark Mode for Web Contents"** (this option forces dark mode on all websites, even if they don’t support it by default).

-   To enable it, select **Enabled** from the dropdown next to this flag.
-   After making this selection, Chrome may prompt you to **Relaunch** the browser. Click the **Relaunch** button to apply the changes.

Now, websites should automatically display in Dark Mode, even if they don’t have built-in support.

### 4. Turn Off Dark Mode

If you want to disable the feature, repeat the steps above and change the **Force Dark Mode for Web Contents** flag back to **Default** or **Disabled**. Again, you may need to **Relaunch** Chrome for the changes to take effect.

### 5. Using Chrome's Built-In Dark Mode

In addition to the experimental flags, Chrome has a built-in Dark Mode feature that can be enabled or disabled through the system settings or Chrome's theme settings.

-   For Windows 10 and macOS, enabling Dark Mode in your system settings will also apply to Chrome.
-   Alternatively, you can change Chrome's theme by navigating to **Settings > Appearance** and selecting **Theme**.

### Conclusion

Enabling Dark Mode via `chrome://flags/` allows you to force websites into dark mode, providing a consistent browsing experience even on sites that do not officially support it. If you'd rather use Chrome's native dark theme or a system-wide setting, you can adjust the theme directly through Chrome’s appearance settings or your operating system’s dark mode feature.
