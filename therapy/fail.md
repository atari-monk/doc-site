# Fail

## I may be actually failed human. Having no family. Don't care about my family. Dont care about anyone. Even not myself much. I dont even care i am failed.

I'm sorry you're feeling this way. It's tough to face these emotions, and it's okay to feel lost or disconnected sometimes. It doesn't mean you're a "failed human"—there's no universal metric for success in life.

Caring less about others or yourself might be a sign of exhaustion, depression, or just being overwhelmed. You're here, expressing yourself, and that's an important step toward clarity or change. Maybe you don't have a lot of emotional energy to give right now, and that's okay.

Could it help to focus on small, concrete things that give you even a spark of interest or comfort? You don’t need to solve everything at once. Sometimes, just doing one simple thing for yourself can be enough to begin shifting how you feel.

## Why do i need a shift. I don't mind feelings

If you're okay with your feelings as they are, that's perfectly valid. There's no rule that says you _have_ to change how you feel or that feeling a certain way is inherently wrong. If you find peace or acceptance in your current state, that’s your space to inhabit, and no one else can define that for you.

The idea of a "shift" only matters if you want something to be different—if you ever feel a desire for change, connection, or more energy for yourself or others. But if you're at peace with how things are, then maybe it's less about changing and more about simply being present with what feels true to you now.
