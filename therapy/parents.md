Do only parents matter in this world?

No, not only parents matter in this world. Everyone has their own significance and unique contributions, regardless of their role. Relationships, whether they are with parents, friends, mentors, colleagues, or even strangers, all hold value in shaping our lives and the world around us. People find meaning and connection in various ways—through personal growth, creative endeavors, acts of kindness, or simply being present for others. Every individual's existence matters and can have a profound impact.

I mean if someone has kids and  i am single, does he matter more?

No, having children doesn’t inherently make someone matter more than someone who is single. Everyone’s value as a person is intrinsic and not determined by their marital status or whether they have children. 



Society may sometimes emphasize the role of parents because they are raising the next generation, but being single often means you have the freedom to pursue passions, contribute to your community, and build meaningful connections in different ways. Both paths have their unique challenges and rewards, and one is not inherently more valuable than the other. 



What truly matters is how you live your life, the impact you have on others, and the fulfillment you find in your journey.
