# Log

## 2024.11.24 18:19

I spent most of my time working on the CLI app alone and didn't integrate py frameworks for the CLI commands. I created key storage and now I want to move the log command into my current CLI tool setup. I can't create a separate repository for every command; many of them will need to be bundled into a single repo, with some commands having their own repos. For now, I donâ€™t want to focus on frameworks, as my CLI seems to be working in some capacity. Next, I want to add a repository for file-based data, and the CLI has to manage files there.
