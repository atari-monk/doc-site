This error occurs because the built-in Python HTTP server (`http.server`) does not set the correct MIME type for JavaScript modules (which require `application/javascript`).



Here's how you can fix it:



### Updated Python Server with Correct MIME Types



```python

import http.server

import socketserver

import mimetypes



PORT = 8000



class CustomHandler(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):

    # Override the MIME type guessing method

    def guess_type(self, path):

        mime_type, _ = mimetypes.guess_type(path)

        # Correct the MIME type for JavaScript modules

        if path.endswith(".js"):

            return "application/javascript"

        return mime_type



# Start the server with the custom handler

with socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), CustomHandler) as httpd:

    print(f"Serving at http://127.0.0.1:{PORT}")

    httpd.serve_forever()

```



### Steps to Use This Updated Server



1. Save the code in a file, for example, `static_server_with_mime_fix.py`.

2. Place your `index.html`, JavaScript files (`*.js`), CSS files, and other static assets in the same directory where you will run this script.

3. Start the server:

   ```bash

   python static_server_with_mime_fix.py

   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).



### Why This Happens

- The built-in `http.server` guesses MIME types based on file extensions.

- By default, `.js` files are served as `text/plain`, which is not valid for JavaScript modules.

- Overriding the `guess_type` method ensures that `.js` files are served as `application/javascript`.
