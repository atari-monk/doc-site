# Task Analysis

## No i meant something diffrent. This should be helping to think on discovering next task in structured way. For example we cold ask question like what is your middle term goal ? What is short term goal. Have you established next task yet ? And then more question helping discover what it should be and collectiong this in data to then at the end establish task and log it

Ah, I see! You're looking for a CLI tool to help you reflect on your goals and structure the process of discovering your next task by asking reflective questions. This tool would guide you through a series of structured questions to help you define short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals, as well as your next task. It would then log your answers to help you track your progress.

### Concept:

1. **Structured Reflection**: The loop will ask questions to help you reflect on your goals and progress.
2. **Task Discovery**: Through these questions, the tool will help you clarify your next task.
3. **Data Collection**: The responses will be logged in a structured way (e.g., as a JSON file).
4. **Log Next Task**: After reflecting, the loop will help you log your next task for clarity and follow-through.

### Steps to Build This CLI Tool:

1. **Start with High-Level Questions**: Begin by asking about the larger context (goals, motivations).
2. **Break Down into Smaller Tasks**: Drill down from long-term to short-term goals, and then define your immediate next task.
3. **Reflect and Log**: At the end of the loop, log the task and the reflections into a file (JSON format, for example).

Here’s an implementation that follows this structure:

### Example Code:

```python
import json
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Function to ask high-level questions
def ask_high_level_goals():
    print("Let's reflect on your goals to discover your next task.")

    medium_term_goal = input("What is your medium-term goal? (6-12 months): ")
    short_term_goal = input("What is your short-term goal? (1-3 months): ")
    long_term_goal = input("What is your long-term goal? (1-5 years): ")

    print(f"\nMedium-Term Goal: {medium_term_goal}")
    print(f"Short-Term Goal: {short_term_goal}")
    print(f"Long-Term Goal: {long_term_goal}")

    return {
        "medium_term_goal": medium_term_goal,
        "short_term_goal": short_term_goal,
        "long_term_goal": long_term_goal
    }

# Function to ask task-related questions
def ask_next_task():
    next_task = input("\nHave you established your next task yet? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()

    if next_task == 'yes':
        task = input("What is your next task? Please describe it: ")
        deadline = input("What is the deadline for this task? (optional): ")
    else:
        print("\nLet's brainstorm what your next task might be...")
        task = input("What is something small you can do in the next few days? ")
        deadline = input("Do you have a deadline for this task? (optional): ")

    return {"task": task, "deadline": deadline}

# Log data to JSON file
def log_task(data):
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    file_path = 'tasks_log.json'

    # Check if the log file exists
    if os.path.exists(file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            existing_data = json.load(f)
    else:
        existing_data = []

    data['timestamp'] = timestamp
    existing_data.append(data)

    # Write back to the log file
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(existing_data, f, indent=2)

# Main loop to structure goal setting and task discovery
def main_loop():
    print("Welcome to the Task Discovery CLI!\n")
    continue_loop = True

    while continue_loop:
        print("\nLet's start by reflecting on your goals...\n")
        goals = ask_high_level_goals()

        print("\nNow, let's figure out your next task...\n")
        task_data = ask_next_task()

        # Combine goal and task data
        full_data = {**goals, **task_data}

        # Log the task and goals
        log_task(full_data)

        # Ask if the user wants to continue
        continue_choice = input("\nWould you like to review or add another task? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()
        if continue_choice != 'yes':
            continue_loop = False

    print("Thank you! Your tasks have been logged.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_loop()
```

### Key Components:

1. **Goal Reflection**:
    - The script starts by asking about **medium-term**, **short-term**, and **long-term** goals.
2. **Task Discovery**:
    - It checks whether you’ve already established your next task.
    - If not, it prompts you to brainstorm and define a small, actionable task.
3. **Data Logging**:
    - After discovering the task, it logs the collected data (goals and tasks) in a JSON file with timestamps.
4. **Loop**:
    - The loop continues until you decide that you’re done, allowing multiple reflections and task discoveries.

### Example of Logged JSON Output:

```json
[
    {
        "medium_term_goal": "Complete the game engine prototype",
        "short_term_goal": "Fix bugs in renderer",
        "long_term_goal": "Launch first game by next year",
        "task": "Fix the collision detection issue",
        "deadline": "2024-12-01",
        "timestamp": "2024-11-27 10:30:00"
    },
    {
        "medium_term_goal": "Learn Unreal Engine",
        "short_term_goal": "Complete tutorial for UE5",
        "long_term_goal": "Create a fully playable game in Unreal Engine",
        "task": "Work through the first tutorial in Unreal Engine",
        "deadline": "2024-11-30",
        "timestamp": "2024-11-27 11:00:00"
    }
]
```

### Flow of the CLI:

1. **Initial Questions**: You are prompted to think about your long-term, medium-term, and short-term goals.
2. **Next Task Discovery**: You are asked if you have a clear next task. If not, the CLI will help you brainstorm one.
3. **Data Collection**: The data (goals and tasks) is saved with a timestamp to a `tasks_log.json` file.
4. **Repeat**: The process repeats until you feel satisfied with your reflections and task log.

### Customization:

-   You can adjust the questions based on what you need to reflect on, add more granular questions for each task (e.g., difficulty, resources needed), or introduce categories of tasks (e.g., development, personal).
-   You could also include options to modify or review previous entries in the log.

This tool will help you think in a structured way, guiding you through both goal reflection and task identification, while keeping a log for future reference.

## You told about popular methods of Task Analysis. Can u give py code to ghater these data from cli ?

Here’s a Python script to gather task analysis data from the CLI, structured to guide the user through each of the methods we discussed: SMART, GROW, Eisenhower Matrix, etc.

This script will ask a series of questions, collect the data, and then output it as a JSON file with all the necessary metadata.

```python
import json
import datetime

def get_input(prompt, validation_fn=None, error_message="Invalid input"):
    while True:
        user_input = input(prompt).strip()
        if validation_fn:
            if validation_fn(user_input):
                return user_input
            else:
                print(error_message)
        else:
            if user_input:
                return user_input
            else:
                print(error_message)

    while True:
        user_input = input(prompt).strip()
        try:

    # Step 7: Task Summary and Logging
    print("\nStep 7: Task Summary and Logging")
    task_summary = {
        "goal": task_data['goal'],

        with open(file_name + '.json', 'w') as f:
            json.dump(task_summary, f, indent=4)
        print(f"Task logged to {file_name}.json")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    task_analysis()
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Input Collection:**

    - We use `get_input()` to collect responses from the user.
    - `get_date_input()` ensures the user provides a valid date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

2. **SMART Goal Questions:**
   The first part focuses on defining the short-term and long-term goals and establishing measurable criteria for success.

3. **Current Situation (GROW - Reality):**
   Users are asked about their current situation, available resources, challenges, and additional help needed.

4. **Prioritization (Eisenhower Matrix):**
   The task is evaluated for urgency and importance. The output helps classify the task for prioritization.

5. **Exploring Options (GROW - Options):**
   The user will input possible approaches to complete the task and choose the best option, explaining why it was selected.

6. **Commitment (GROW - Will):**
   The user sets their next steps, establishes a timeline, and explains how progress will be tracked.

7. **OKR Key Results:**
   Defines the metrics for success and how to adjust if progress isn’t met.

8. **Task Summary and Logging:**
   After gathering all the information, the tool outputs the task summary and asks if the user wants to save it to a JSON file. If the user agrees, the data is saved in the specified file.
