# Chair

Sitting properly on a chair is crucial for maintaining good posture and overall health. Here’s a science-backed strategy for sitting effectively:

### 1. **Set Up the Chair and Workstation**

-   **Adjust Seat Height**:  
    The chair should allow your feet to rest flat on the ground with your knees at a 90-degree angle or slightly lower than your hips.
-   **Seat Depth**:  
    There should be about 2–4 inches of space between the back of your knees and the front edge of the chair.
-   **Backrest**:  
    Adjust the backrest to support the natural curve of your spine, particularly the lower back (lumbar region).

### 2. **Position Yourself on the Chair**

-   **Sit Back Fully**:  
    Sit all the way back so your back is supported by the backrest. Avoid perching on the edge.
-   **Keep Hips Even**:  
    Ensure your hips are level and not tilted to one side.

### 3. **Body Alignment**

-   **Feet**:  
    Keep your feet flat on the floor or on a footrest if needed. Avoid crossing your legs.
-   **Knees**:  
    Position your knees at or just below the level of your hips.
-   **Spine**:  
    Maintain a slight natural curve in your lower back. Avoid slouching or over-arching.
-   **Shoulders**:  
    Relax your shoulders and keep them level. Avoid hunching forward.
-   **Head**:  
    Keep your head aligned with your spine, with your ears in line with your shoulders.

### 4. **Desk and Monitor Position**

-   **Desk Height**:  
    Your elbows should form a 90–120-degree angle when your hands rest on the keyboard or work surface.
-   **Monitor Position**:  
    The top of your screen should be at or slightly below eye level, about 20–28 inches from your eyes.

### 5. **Micro-Movements and Breaks**

-   **Shift Positions**:  
    Change your sitting position slightly every 30 minutes to prevent stiffness.
-   **Stand and Stretch**:  
    Stand up and move around for 5–10 minutes every hour.
-   **Desk Exercises**:  
    Include stretches like shoulder rolls, neck tilts, or seated spinal twists.

### 6. **Ergonomic Accessories**

-   **Footrest**:  
    Use one if your feet don’t comfortably reach the floor.
-   **Lumbar Support**:  
    Use a cushion or a chair with built-in lumbar support for your lower back.
-   **Ergonomic Keyboard and Mouse**:  
    Position them so your wrists are straight, and your arms stay close to your body.

### 7. **Mindful Sitting**

-   Practice mindfulness of your posture throughout the day, as bad habits like slouching often occur unconsciously.
-   Consider reminders, like posture-correcting devices or phone alarms, to check your position.

By maintaining these habits, you can improve posture, reduce back and neck pain, and boost overall comfort and productivity while sitting.
